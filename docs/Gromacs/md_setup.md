# Running a simulation in Gromacs

These brief instructions are a general guide to how to run a simple MD simulation using 
Gromacs. In this case we are simulating the alanine dipeptide using Gromacs 2018 but 
things should not change too much for other recent versions of the software. You must 
have a working version installed in your machine. First of all, you will have to 
download the compressed files in
[alaTB_files.tar.gz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V6fZSjJbAAqDeQY_J5BHu0GQuj6eMtNx/view?usp=sharing)
to your computer and extract them typing 
```
tar -xvf ala_TB_files.tar.gz
```
in your terminal.

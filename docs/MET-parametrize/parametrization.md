# Parametrizing an amino acid using AmberTools21

In order to paramterize an amino acid, the first thing we need
is an structure. Conventionally, the structure used to parametrize
an amino acid is to build an structure with the amino acid with
ACE and NME caps, e.g., if I want to parametrize a methionine my
structure will be ACE-MET-NME. To do so, we need to build the amino
acid using the building software of our liking (Amber's tleap, 
Gaussview or any other works). The structure built for this tutorial
can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14VTesUlBdBR3O2gln5xxqVhOX5dlqAq7/view?usp=sharing).

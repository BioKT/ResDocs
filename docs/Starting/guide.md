# Getting started guide
There is so much to say about molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
that at the beginning it may seem a bit daunting. Below we list 
a few resources that may be useful to step into the world of MD.

1. Fundamentals of MD simulations
	* Best Practices for Foundations in Molecular Simulations, Braun et al. *Living J. Comp. Mol. Sci.* (2019). DOI: [10.33011/livecoms.1.1.5957](https://doi.org/10.33011/livecoms.1.1.5957)

2. The Gromacs software package
	* Justin Lemkul's tutorials page: [http://www.mdtutorials.com/](http://www.mdtutorials.com/)

3. Analysis packages:
	* The MDtraj Python library: [http://mdtraj.org](http://mdtraj.org/1.2.0/whatsnew.html)

4. Coarse grained models
	* [SMOG](http://smog-server.org): This webtool allows for you to generate parameters to run coarse-grained simulations in Gromacs with the famous [Clementi model](https://doi.org/10.1006/jmbi.2000.3693).

5. Visualization
	* [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/): An incredible program for visualizing your MD simulation data. You can find a tutorial [here](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/vmd/tutorial-html/index.html).

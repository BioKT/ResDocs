# About

This is the documentation website for the BioKT group at the 
[University of the Basque Country](https://www.ehu.eus) and
the [Donostia International Physics Center](http://dipc.ehu.es).
We are a team lead by Xabier Lopez and David De Sancho that
focuses on the study of the conformational dynamics of biomolecules
 with computational methods, in particular molecular simulation
and quantum mechanical calculations. You can find more information
 about the work we do in our
[website](https://sites.google.com/view/biokt).
Much of the code we write is hosted in 
[Github](https://github.com/biokt).
In this website you will find information about a number of 
common tools that we use in our research.

# About

My name is David De Sancho and currently I am a Ramon y Cajal fellow in the 
[University of the Basque Country](https://www.ehu.eus) and
the [Donostia International Physics Center](http://dipc.ehu.es).
My work focuses on the study of the conformational dynamics of biomolecules with
computational methods, primarily molecular simulation.
You can find more information about the work we do in my 
[website](https://sites.google.com/view/daviddesanchoresearch)
or check my updated list of publications in 
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KJizEBYAAAAJ&hl=en).
Much of the code I write is hosted in [Github](https://github.com/daviddesancho).
In this website you will find information about a number of common tools that we use
in our research.
